You are required to write a program that simulates the rolling of two dice. Specifically, your program will:
•	Simulate 500 rolls of two six-sided dice 
•	Display a table that summarizes the data in the manner shown below, and
•	Display the dice total with the highest frequency

Total	Simulated Percentage
2	2.70
3	7.10
4	9.30
5	12.00
6	14.50
7	13.90
8	15.00
9	9.50
10	8.90
11	4.30
12	2.80

Your program must fulfil the following requirements: 
•	It must have a function that simulates the random rolling of the pair of six-sided dice. The function will not take any parameters. But it will return the total that was rolled on the two dice as its only result. 
•	The main program will make use or call the function to simulate the rolling of the pair of six-sided dice 500 times. 
•	As the program runs, it must count the number of times that each total occurs. 
•	Then it should display a table that summarizes the data as shown above. The table shows:
o	The value of total, in order of increasing value
o	The frequency for each total as a percentage of the total number of rolls, up to 2 decimal points. 
•	It must also display the dice total with the highest simulated percentage
