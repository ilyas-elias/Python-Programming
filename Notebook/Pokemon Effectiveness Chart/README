# Pokemon Type Effectiveness Chart
Pokemon GO allows a player to battle other players with parties of three Pokemons.  A player wins when he manages to knock out his opponent's team of Pok√©mons.  Like the game of Scissors-Paper-Stone, some Pokemon are "stronger" than other Pokemons.  For example, Grass-type Pokemons are stronger than Water-type Pokemons, Water-type Pokemons are stronger than Fire-type Pokemons and in turn, Fire-type Pokemons are stronger than Grass-type Pokemons.  The strategy to win a Pokemon battle is to choose Pokemon types that are "stronger" than your opponent's Pokemon types.

The 7th row in the above table defines the strength, weakness and immunity of the _attacking_ __FIGHTING__ type in relation with the other types.  There are five _green +_ in this row indicating that the Fighting type is **strong** (super effective) against Normal, Ice, Rock, Dark and Steel types.  Also, there are five _red -_ in this row indicating that the Fighting type is **weak** (not very effective) against Poison, Flying, Psychic, Bug and Fairy types.  Then the _black X_ indicates that the Ghost type is **immune** to the Fighting type.  Or, we can say that the Fighting type is _double not very effective_ against the Ghost type.  Finally, the rest of the white spaces indicate that the Fighting type is normal or **neutral** effective against Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Fighting (itself), Ground and Dragon types. 

From the _defending_ perspective, let's consider the __FLYING__ type of Pokemon as indicated in the 10th column.  A Flying type pokemon is **resistant** to Grass, Fighting and Bug attack moves.  It is **vulnerable** to Electric, Ice and Rock attack moves.  It is **immuned** to Ground attack moves.  It is **neutral** (normal effective) to Normal, Fire, Water, Poison, Flying, Psychic, Ghost, Dragon, Dark, Steel and Fairy attack moves.

All Pokemons are either _single-type_ or _dual-type_.  For example, Pikachu (Electric) is a single-type while Balbasaur (Grass/Poison) is a dual-type. For Pokemons that are dual-type, the order of the types is insignificant in battling.  For example WATER/ICE is the same as ICE/WATER.  When an attack move is executed against a dual-type Pokemon, the effectiveness or the ineffectiveness against each of type are _multiplied_ together.  In the case of against one type is **not very effective** and against the other type is **super effective**, they cancel each other and become **normal** or **neutral effective**.  There can be occasions when the attack move is **super effective** or **not very effective** on both types, then the move becomes **double super effective** or **double not very effective**.  

Consider the example of a __GROUND__ type attack against Balbasaur which is __GRASS__/__POISON__.  The Ground against Grass is **not very effective** (0.625) and the Ground against Poison is **super effective** (1.6).  The result of the multiplication of 0.625 and 1.6 is 1.0 which is **normal** or **neutral effective**.
